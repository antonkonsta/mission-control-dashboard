# Workout Routine Planning

## Current Decision Point
Deciding between two lifting schedules:

### Option 1: Every Other Day (4/3 day weeks)
- Heavy lifting every other day consistently
- One day break between each session
- Alternates between 4-day weeks and 3-day weeks
- More frequent lifting

### Option 2: 3 Days Per Week
- Fixed 3 days of heavy lifting
- More recovery time
- More room for other activities

## Research Needed to Decide
1. **Core workouts** - What are the essential lifts I need?
2. **Frequency** - How many times per week should I hit each muscle group?
3. **Other exercise requirements:**
   - Cardio
   - Boxing (want to pick this up)
   - HIIT (important for testosterone production, pushing yourself)

## Considerations
- Boxing might include HIIT naturally
- Need to weigh total exercise load
- 3-day lifting might be better if boxing/cardio takes significant time
- Recovery is important

## Next Steps
- Research optimal lifting frequency
- Look into boxing programs
- Determine how HIIT fits in
- Make final schedule decision
