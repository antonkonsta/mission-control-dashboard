Token tracking system that logs: task_id, agent_id, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, timestamp\n2. NEW \"Token Tracking\" page in Agent Activity Monitor with THREE visualizations:\n   a) LINE CHART: Total token usage over time (hourly/daily), with cost overlay\n   b) STACKED BAR CHART: Per-task breakdown, segments for input/output, shows cost per task\n   c) TREEMAP/SUNBURST: Hierarchical view - Total \u2192 Categories (Heartbeat/Tasks/Ad-hoc) \u2192 Individual items\n3. ACTIVE AGENTS page update: Show tokens used + cost per agent card\n4. AGENT HISTORY page update: Show total tokens + cost for each historical agent\n5. Cost estimation showing tokens + dollars side by side everywhere\n6. Model-aware tracking (correct rates per model per agent)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony can see at a glance how much each task costs (tokens + dollars)\n- Anthony can predict monthly billing from dashboard\n- Clear breakdown of where tokens are going (heartbeat vs tasks vs agents)\n- All visualizations update LIVE (within 30 seconds of token usage)\n- Cost estimates match actual GitHub billing within reasonable margin\n- Token Tracking is a dedicated tab in Agent Activity Monitor",

Dashboard update: Show \"Updated: [timestamp]\" on each task card (visible without clicking)\n2. Dashboard update: Sort tasks within each column by lastUpdated descending (newest first)\n3. mc CLI update: Ensure every operation updates the lastUpdated field\n4. Identity file updates: HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md - hardcode the rule to always add comments on changes\n5. Create skill or script that documents/enforces this behavior\n6. Auto-comment on subtask changes (when crossing off, adding, or modifying subtasks)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony can see which tasks were updated most recently without opening them\n- Most recently updated tasks float to top of each column\n- Every subtask change triggers a comment explaining what changed\n- Agent behavior is hardcoded - never forgets to update timestamps and add comments",
