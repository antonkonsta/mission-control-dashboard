Dashboard update: Show \"Updated: [timestamp]\" on each task card (visible without clicking)\n2. Dashboard update: Sort tasks within each column by lastUpdated descending (newest first)\n3. mc CLI update: Ensure every operation updates the lastUpdated field\n4. Identity file updates: HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md - hardcode the rule to always add comments on changes\n5. Create skill or script that documents/enforces this behavior\n6. Auto-comment on subtask changes (when crossing off, adding, or modifying subtasks)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony can see which tasks were updated most recently without opening them\n- Most recently updated tasks float to top of each column\n- Every subtask change triggers a comment explaining what changed\n- Agent behavior is hardcoded - never forgets to update timestamps and add comments",
