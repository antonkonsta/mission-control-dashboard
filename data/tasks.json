Token logging infrastructure capturing per-request usage\n2. NEW dedicated Token Tracking page in Activity Monitor with 3 visualizations\n3. Updated Active Agents page with tokens + cost per agent\n4. Updated History page with tokens + cost for historical agents\n5. Live auto-refresh (30 second intervals)\n6. **Baseline cost storage** - ability to set starting balance from GitHub billing\n7. **Cumulative total display** - baseline + tracked usage = total shown\n8. Cost prediction that matches GitHub billing\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Can see at a glance: total spend, per-agent breakdown, per-task costs\n- Refresh within 30 seconds shows updated data\n- Anthony provides baseline, tracks for days, checks GitHub - values match\n- Monthly reset capability when Anthony notifies of new billing cycle",

Dashboard update: Show \"Updated: [timestamp]\" on each task card (visible without clicking)\n2.

Auto-comment on subtask changes (when crossing off, adding, or modifying subtasks)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony can see which tasks were updated most recently without opening them\n- Most recently updated tasks float to top of each column\n- Every subtask change triggers a comment explaining what changed\n- Agent behavior is hardcoded - never forgets to update timestamps and add comments",
