Token logging infrastructure capturing per-request usage\n2. NEW dedicated Token Tracking page in Activity Monitor with 3 visualizations\n3. Updated Active Agents page with tokens + cost per agent\n4. Updated History page with tokens + cost for historical agents\n5. Live auto-refresh (30 second intervals)\n6. **Baseline cost storage** - ability to set starting balance from GitHub billing\n7. **Cumulative total display** - baseline + tracked usage = total shown\n8. Cost prediction that matches GitHub billing\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Can see at a glance: total spend, per-agent breakdown, per-task costs\n- Refresh within 30 seconds shows updated data\n- Anthony provides baseline, tracks for days, checks GitHub - values match\n- Monthly reset capability when Anthony notifies of new billing cycle",

FIX CURRENT ISSUES:\n   - Current tracking shows Opus at $100+ which is INACCURATE\n   - When user enters GitHub balance, RESET all prior usage tracking\n   - Only count usage FROM that point forward\n   - Clear explanation of discrepancy between our estimates and actual billing\n\n3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:\n   - How to accurately predict costs based on our token tracking\n   - How to align our tracking with GitHub's billing model\n   - Account for included allowance before extra charges kick in\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Research must be thorough and accurate\n- Must understand the ACTUAL billing model, not assumptions\n- PDF report required\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1.
