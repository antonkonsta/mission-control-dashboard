      "description": "OBJECTIVE: Build AgentScope - a comprehensive, real-time web dashboard to monitor ALL agent activity with intelligent classification and agent-specific panes.\n\nAGENTSCOPE SPECIFICATIONS:\n\n1. INTELLIGENT LOGGER & CLASSIFICATION:\n   - Captures EVERYTHING: tool calls, internal thinking messages, Telegram responses, user messages, agent-to-agent messages\n   - Auto-classifies each event type:\n     * tool_call - when agent executes a tool\n     * thinking - internal reasoning/thought process\n     * response - message sent to Telegram/user\n     * user_message - message received from user\n     * agent_message - message from other agents\n     * decision - agent makes a decision\n     * skill_use - agent uses a skill\n   - Each event shows: timestamp, session ID, event type, content summary\n\n2. AGENT PANES (One per spawned agent):\n   - Main session agent always visible\n   - One pane for each active sub-agent\n   - Each pane header shows:\n     * Agent name (derived from task/project/label)\n     * Model being used (e.g., kimi-k2.5, claude-opus)\n     * Last update timestamp (e.g., '2 min ago')\n     * Live/dead status indicator\n\n3. 10-MINUTE TIMEOUT & ARCHIVING:\n   - Active agents: last activity within 10 minutes\n   - After 10 min of inactivity \u2192 moved to 'Archived Agents' page\n   - Separate page/view for archived/dead agents\n   - Main dashboard only shows ACTIVE agents\n\n4. REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL FEED (Newest at TOP):\n   - Unlike typical chat (oldest at top), AgentScope shows NEWEST events at top\n   - Each agent pane displays its event stream\n   - Events shown:\n     * Tool calls (tool name, params, result preview)\n     * Thinking messages (reasoning process)\n     * Skills being used\n     * Decisions being made\n     * Responses being sent\n     * User messages received\n   - Auto-scroll to keep newest visible\n\n5. DATA SOURCES TO INTEGRATE:\n   - /root/.openclaw/workspace/data/actions.jsonl - streaming events\n   - /root/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl - session transcripts\n   - openclaw sessions list --json - live session metadata\n   - /root/.openclaw/workspace/logs/activity-stream.jsonl - activity logs\n\n6. VISUAL DESIGN:\n   - Dark theme (distinct from previous monitors)\n   - Color-coded event types\n   - Collapsible/expandable agent panes\n   - Responsive layout (grid of agent cards)\n   - Main session highlighted prominently\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Start in BACKLOG only - do NOT move to in_progress without explicit approval\n- Must handle high-frequency updates efficiently\n- Must not impact agent performance\n- Use existing Flask server (monitor_server.py) as base\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. AgentScope architecture with event classification system\n2. Backend event aggregator/parser from multiple sources\n3. Real-time SSE streaming endpoint\n4. Frontend with agent panes and reverse chronological feeds\n5. Active/Archived agent management with 10-min timeout\n6. Deployment and validation\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony sees live AgentScope with all agent panes\n- Every tool call, thought, response visible and classified\n- Newest events appear at top of each pane\n- Agents auto-archive after 10 min inactivity\n- Main session and all sub-agents visible with names, models, timestamps",
