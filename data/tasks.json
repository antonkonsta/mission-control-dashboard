Dashboard update: Show \"Updated: [timestamp]\" on each task card (visible without clicking)\n2. Dashboard update: Sort tasks within each column by lastUpdated descending (newest first)\n3. mc CLI update: Ensure every operation updates the lastUpdated field\n4. Identity file updates: HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, SOUL.md - hardcode the rule to always add comments on changes\n5. Create skill or script that documents/enforces this behavior\n6. Auto-comment on subtask changes (when crossing off, adding, or modifying subtasks)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony can see which tasks were updated most recently without opening them\n- Most recently updated tasks float to top of each column\n- Every subtask change triggers a comment explaining what changed\n- Agent behavior is hardcoded - never forgets to update timestamps and add comments",

Establish cost-efficient, high-performance local infrastructure with Anthropic Opus as primary orchestrator.\n\nEXPECTATIONS FROM ANTHONY:\n- Research cost-efficient local LLM options (most capable models like Opus equivalent)\n- Identify best self-hosted LLM providers (Ollama, vLLM, LocalAI, etc.)\n- Determine hardware requirements for desktop (VRAM, CPU, storage)\n- Calculate total cost of ownership vs current GitHub Copilot subscription\n- Plan data migration strategy from VPS to local desktop\n- Design OpenClaw deployment architecture for local hardware\n- Identify any limitations or trade-offs vs cloud-based approach\n- Provide step-by-step migration plan with rollback strategy\n- Ensure Anthropic Opus (or equivalent local model) runs efficiently as main orchestrator\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Desktop computer at home (finite hardware resources)\n- Must maintain all current OpenClaw functionality\n- Local-only deployment (no cloud dependencies except where unavoidable)\n- Cost efficiency is primary driver (cheaper than GitHub Copilot subscription)\n- Research phase ONLY - no implementation yet\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. Comprehensive research report on local LLM landscape (2026)\n   - Top 3-5 candidates ranked by capability/cost/local support\n   - Specific focus on Anthropic Opus alternatives for local deployment\n   \n2. Hardware requirements analysis\n   - VRAM needed for different model sizes\n   - CPU/GPU recommendations\n   - Storage requirements for models + OpenClaw\n   - Network bandwidth considerations\n   \n3. Cost analysis\n   - Total hardware cost amortized over useful life\n   - Electricity costs for 24/7 operation\n   - Annual cost vs GitHub Copilot (savings projection)\n   \n4. Architecture design document\n   - How OpenClaw interfaces with local LLM\n   - Model switching strategy (multiple models on same hardware)\n   - API layer design (ollama/vLLM REST endpoints)\n   - Cache and optimization strategy\n   \n5. Data migration plan\n   - What data moves from VPS to desktop\n   - What stays cloud-based (if anything)\n   - Backup and recovery strategy\n   - Timeline estimate for cutover\n   \n6. Deployment guide (draft)\n   - Step-by-step setup for local LLM inference\n   - OpenClaw configuration for local models\n   - Testing and validation procedures\n   - Rollback procedures if issues arise\n\n7. Risk assessment\n   - Limitations of local vs cloud\n   - Uptime/reliability considerations\n   - Performance degradation scenarios\n   - Mitigation strategies\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Anthony has clear understanding of feasibility and costs\n- Top local LLM option identified with evidence\n- Hardware specs clearly defined for desktop\n- Cost savings quantified (vs GitHub Copilot)\n- Step-by-step migration path documented\n- Ready for Anthony approval to begin implementation",
