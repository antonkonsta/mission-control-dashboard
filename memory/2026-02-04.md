# Session Log: 2026-02-04

## Chip Design Automation Obsidian Vault

### Location
`/root/.openclaw/workspace/obsidian-vaults/chip-design-automation/`

### Files Created/Updated This Session

1. **MAIN-Complete-Documentation.md** (37KB) - Master consolidated document with all content, table of contents, elaborated (not summarized). Includes all topics from the vault organized into 11 sections.

2. **Pareto-Layers-Exploration.md** - Pareto Peeling concept: remove rejected Pareto points and recalculate to reveal next layer of optimal points

3. **User-Experience-Design.md** - Dual interface (visual + CLI/AI-agent), parallel coordinate plots, objective weighting, device biasing flow with unbias/redo capability

4. **Project-Folder-Structure.md** - Project folder auto-discovery concept:
   - Folder naming conventions (e.g., `5T_OTA_tsmc65_v1/`)
   - Auto-discovery from Spectre netlist
   - Matched device inference from connectivity
   - Visual circuit generation options
   - Example topology.json output
   - project.yaml configuration file format

### Key Concepts Documented

1. **Matched Devices**: In a 5T OTA, matched pairs (M1/M2 input, M3/M4 mirror) are treated as single logical devices → 5 transistors become 3 logical devices

2. **VDS Constraint Propagation**: If VDD=1.8V and mirror VDS=0.5V, input VDS=0.9V, then tail VDS is automatically locked to 0.4V (no sweep needed)

3. **Pareto Layers (Pareto Peeling)**: Remove rejected Pareto points, recalculate to explore deeper without re-running sweeps

4. **Two-Level Sweep Architecture**: 
   - Inner sweep: Always fine resolution (5mV, 10nm)
   - Outer sweep: Adaptive based on time budget

5. **Solution Space Narrowing**: Each biased device constrains remaining devices, reducing sweep dimensions

### MVP UI Discussed

4 screens proposed for MVP:
1. **Project Setup** - Point to folder, confirm devices/matching
2. **Constraint Entry** - Manual text/form entry (no auto-derivation for MVP)
3. **Device Biasing** - Main screen: device cards, run sweep, Pareto scatter plot, accept/reject points
4. **Results Summary** - Final bias points, export to Cadence

### Voice Message Transcriptions

Anthony explained key algorithm concepts:
- How matched devices reduce the problem (5T → 3 logical devices)
- VDS constraint propagation example with concrete numbers
- Pareto layers for deeper exploration
- Objective weighting (gain > BW > power > noise)
- Project folder structure with netlist auto-discovery
- Need for practical MVP - "can't iterate forever, need a working solution"

### PDFs Generated

1. `chip-design-automation-pdfs.zip` - 8 PDFs from the vault (sent to Anthony)
2. `Chip-Design-Automation-Complete-Documentation.pdf` - 188KB master PDF with all content (sent to Anthony)

### Obsidian Mobile Access

Anthony asked about accessing vault on phone. Options discussed:
- Obsidian Sync (paid ~$8/mo)
- Cloud folder sync (iCloud/Dropbox/Google Drive)
- Git sync with Obsidian Git plugin + Working Copy (iOS)

No decision made yet on sync method.

### Other Files Referenced

- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/ic-amplifiers/` - Previous IC amplifier knowledge base (34 files) - different from the chip-design-automation vault
- Voice messages transcribed from `/root/.openclaw/media/inbound/file_145*.ogg`, `file_146*.ogg`, `file_147*.ogg`

### Context for Continuity

- Anthony is working on chip design automation tool for analog IC design
- Focus is on 5T OTA initially, but architecture supports other topologies
- Using Cadence ADE + Ocean scripts + Python + SQLite
- Process: TSMC 65nm
- Anthony prefers voice messages for hands-free work
- Session used TTS responses when Anthony requested voice message replies

## Evening Session (7:00 PM - 10:35 PM EST)

### UNCC Policy Research

Anthony asked about UNC Charlotte vaping policies and consequences:
- **University Policy 707**: Vaping explicitly banned in ALL university buildings (includes e-cigarettes, vapes)
- Also banned within 100 feet of buildings
- Violation falls under Code of Student Responsibility (UP-406)
- **Consequences:**
  - First offense: Typically Disciplinary Warning or Disciplinary Probation + educational assignment
  - Repeat offenses: Can escalate to suspension/expulsion
  - Disciplinary Warning = written notice, slap on wrist
  - Disciplinary Probation = "thin ice" for set period, further violations = harsher consequences

### Todoist Tasks Added

1. "Send button STL file to Amanda" - tomorrow, moved to Neurodyne project
2. "Stop at store - buy USB microphone for lab computer" - tomorrow

### Chip Design Automation - NEW FILES ADDED

Extended the vault significantly with high-level design documentation:

1. **Project-Setup-Flow.md** - Full project setup workflow:
   - User prerequisites (create schematic, testbenches, run sims once)
   - Tool discovery flow (scan folder, identify cells)
   - User identifies schematic vs testbenches
   - User defines matched device groups (MANUAL - not auto-detected)
   - Configuration saved to project.yaml

2. **Constraint-Definition-Flow.md** - Constraint handling:
   - User presses "Generate Constraints" → tool guesses KVL/KCL/diode connections
   - User reviews, edits, adds, deletes constraints
   - Philosophy: "Don't over-automate"

3. **Design-Philosophy.md** - Core principle documented:
   - **Guided Automation**: Software automates, user guides
   - User sees every step, stays conscious of what's happening
   - Transparent, not a black box
   - Show your work, ask before acting, let user override, no surprises

4. **Objectives-Definition.md** - Objectives are MANUAL entry:
   - Device-level: gm, gds, ft, gm/Id (from sweep data)
   - Circuit-level: Gain, BW, noise (require testbenches)
   - Can't be guessed - pure design intent

5. **Testbench-Interface.md** - Complex interface requirements:
   - Challenge 1: Injecting values INTO testbenches (bias voltages, component values)
   - Challenge 2: Extracting values FROM testbenches (gain, BW, phase margin)
   - User configures input mappings (constant / from device OP / expression)
   - User defines output expressions to extract
   - Tool runs Ocean scripts, captures results

6. **Complete-Biasing-Workflow.md** - End-to-end flow documented:
   - As each device biased: 5 bias frames + 100 outputs known
   - Pareto front shows device + circuit objectives
   - After all biased: save config, run testbenches, compare estimated vs simulated
   - Satisfied → done; Not satisfied → unbias and re-explore

### Vault File Count

Now 17+ files in chip-design-automation vault.

### Automation Split (Key Decision)

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Devices | Auto-detected from netlist |
| Matched groups | User defines manually |
| Constraints | Tool suggests → user edits |
| Objectives | User enters manually |

### Personal Growth Vault CREATED

New vault: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/obsidian-vaults/personal-growth/`

Anthony wants to document personal development goals - becoming a traditional masculine man who takes care of his household.

**Sections created:**

1. **Car Care & Maintenance**
   - For Ricardo specifically: gas tank always full, key fob batteries, car always clean
   - All maintenance handled by Anthony
   - Mindset: "She shouldn't have to do anything but drive the car"

2. **Home & Household**
   - Always take out trash
   - Lock up house every night
   - Handle heavy lifting, fix things
   - Basic repairs: leaky faucets, loose handles, squeaky doors
   - Help with her projects - drilling, mounting, moving furniture

3. **Providing & Protecting**
   - Know home security
   - Emergency plans and supplies
   - Handle bills, keep cash reserves
   - She never worries about safety or money

4. **Loving Your People**
   - Mom: call regularly, visit often, handle her needs
   - Future wife: lead, provide, handle the hard stuff
   - Future kids: model good manhood, teach son to serve/protect, show daughter what to expect

### Technical Notes

- Gateway was restarted due to crash
- Model switched to github-copilot/claude-opus-4.5
- Anthony requested voice message replies while driving
- Context reached 76% before this memory save
