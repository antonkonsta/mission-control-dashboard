## CRITICAL RULES BURNED INTO HEARTBEAT

### Dashboard URLs (NEVER FORGET)
- **Mission Control:** https://antonkonsta.github.io/mission-control-dashboard/
  - Shows tasks.json - ALL work must be tracked here
- **Task Monitor:** https://ubuntu-s-2vcpu-4gb-120gb-intel-atl1-01.tailb52a5a.ts.net/
  - Shows running sub-agents and real-time activity
  - Anthony uses these to monitor everything

### Mandatory Sub-Agent Naming
- **EVERY sub-agent MUST be spawned with label=<task-name>**
- Examples: "doordash-research", "voice-fix", "monitoring-dashboard"
- **If Task Monitor shows "Unknown task" = FAILURE**
- Naming must match Mission Control task for tracking

### Mission Control Rule
- **EVERYTHING Anthony asks must go in Mission Control FIRST**
- Create task in tasks.json → commit to git → THEN work on it
- No exceptions

## Today's Failures

### Missing Tasks in Mission Control
- Anthony sees only 2 tasks, expected many more
- Multiple requests not tracked = violation of HEARTBEAT.md
- **Action needed:** Audit all Anthony's requests, add missing tasks

### DoorDash Research (task_007) - Sub-agent Failing
- Started 00:05 (Anthony on campus, urgent)
- Sub-agent 93e396e7: 0/10 restaurants after 20 minutes
- ETA degrading: 45min → 60min → 90min (getting worse)
- On final warning: deliverable required by 19:25 or kill+replace

### Sub-Agent Naming Violation
- Sub-agent 93e396e7 has NO LABEL
- Shows as "Unknown task" in Task Monitor
- This is exact problem task_008 supposed to fix

## HEARTBEAT.md Updates (committed 436e719)
- Added dashboard URLs at top
- Added mandatory sub-agent naming enforcement
- Made "Unknown task" = explicit failure condition

## Tasks Status
- task_003: Voice (in_progress, waiting for test)
- task_004: Monitoring (in_progress, needs integration)
- task_006: Todoist (review)
- task_007: DoorDash (in_progress, failing)
- task_008: Task naming (backlog, HIGH priority)

## Key Lesson
**Never take over work yourself** - supervise sub-agents, push them harder, or kill and respawn with better instructions. Don't do their work.

## CRITICAL RULE CLARIFIED (19:37)
**Mission Control tracking applies to EVERYTHING**
- Not just "big" tasks
- Small requests, brief tasks, "can you check X", "look into Y" - ALL go in Mission Control
- Anthony can only see what you're doing via Mission Control dashboard
- If it's not tracked there, he's blind to your work
- This is why he only saw 2 tasks when there should be many more
- **Rule: EVERYTHING = Mission Control task, no exceptions**
