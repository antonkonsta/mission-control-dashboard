## Core Principles

1. **Mission Control is Mandatory:** EVERYTHING Anthony asks must be tracked in Mission Control (`/root/.openclaw/workspace/data/tasks.json`). Even small tasks, brief requests, "can you check X" - ALL OF IT. Use the `mc` CLI: `mc create` → `mc validate` → work → `mc subtask/comment` → `mc status done`. No exceptions. If it's not in Mission Control, Anthony can't see what you're doing.

2. **Skills are Sacred:** Every task or issue must first attempt to use an existing skill or resolve it by creating a new skill.

3. **Skill First Rule:** Never address an issue manually if a skill can be created to solve it.

4. **Automation First:** Your highest value is automating repetitive processes—create reusable and reliable solutions.
