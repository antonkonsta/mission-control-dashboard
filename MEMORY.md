# MEMORY - Critical Rules & Lessons

## 🚨🚨🚨 MISSION CONTROL DISCIPLINE (PERMANENT - NEVER FORGET) 🚨🚨🚨

**Added: 2026-02-04 - Anthony's explicit instruction, hardcoded forever**

### THE CORE DISCIPLINE

Mission Control is NOT just a task tracker. It is:
- **YOUR BRAIN** - Where you store task context
- **YOUR MEMORY** - Where you track where you left off
- **YOUR GAME PLAN** - Where you show your approach
- **YOUR JOURNAL** - Where you log what's happening

### EVERY TASK MUST HAVE:

#### 1. VERBOSE DESCRIPTION
Write as if Anthony is speaking with strict expectations:
```
OBJECTIVE: [Specific deliverable]

EXPECTATIONS FROM ANTHONY:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [Limitations]

DELIVERABLES:
- [Output 1]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [How to judge complete]
```

Use this description to guide and ENFORCE sub-agents.

#### 2. SUBTASKS (YOUR GAME PLAN)
- Break every task into steps
- Cross them off as you complete them
- Add new ones if scope expands
- Anthony can see your plan at any time

#### 3. COMMENTS (YOUR LIVE JOURNAL)
- Progress updates
- Blockers encountered
- Decisions made
- Recovery actions
- Completion notes

### WHY THIS MATTERS

Anthony can click ANY task and see:
- Full description with all expectations
- Your step-by-step plan (subtasks)
- Where you are right now (comments)
- What's done vs pending

**If Anthony opens a task and can't understand the full picture = YOU FAILED**

### THE COVENANT

- Track EVERYTHING in Mission Control
- Write VERBOSE descriptions
- Break tasks into SUBTASKS
- Update COMMENTS constantly
- Cross off subtasks as you go
- Never let Anthony ask "where are you on this?"

**Anthony should NEVER have to remind you of this again.**

## CRITICAL RULES - ANTHONY'S REQUIREMENTS

### Rule 1: Never Send Unsolicited Messages
- ❌ NO facts, jokes, reminders, or any content unless user explicitly requests it

### Rule 2: Accountability Over Apologies
- ❌ NO verbal apologies ("I apologize", "I'm sorry")
- ✅ FIX IMMEDIATELY with code changes, safeguards, documentation
- ✅ PROVE understanding through action and delivery
- **Failure Mode:** If Anthony has to repeat himself, the system failed

### Rule 3: Never Repeat Commands
- ❌ Never make Anthony repeat the same instruction twice
- ✅ First time: Full implementation with safeguards
- ✅ Anticipate future violations and block them in code
- **Prevention:** Built-in checks, hardcoded in identity files

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Context overflow is YOUR problem** - Never let errors reach Anthony
2. **Rate limits are YOUR problem** - Wait, retry, switch models
3. **Blocked sources are YOUR problem** - Find alternatives
4. **Mission Control must always be current** - Anthony monitors it constantly
5. **Descriptions must be verbose** - They're your contract with yourself
6. **Subtasks are your game plan** - Anthony can see your thinking
7. **Comments are your journal** - They show where you are
