# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Work Loop

## MONITORING DASHBOARDS (BURN THIS IN)
- **Mission Control:** https://antonkonsta.github.io/mission-control-dashboard/
  - Shows tasks.json - THIS IS WHERE ALL WORK MUST BE TRACKED
- **Task Monitor:** https://ubuntu-s-2vcpu-4gb-120gb-intel-atl1-01.tailb52a5a.ts.net/
  - Shows running sub-agents and activity in real-time
  - Anthony uses these to monitor everything you do

## CRITICAL RULE: MISSION CONTROL IS MANDATORY
**EVERYTHING Anthony asks you to do MUST be tracked in Mission Control.**
- **EVERYTHING = even small tasks, brief requests, "can you check X", "look into Y" - ALL OF IT**
- Create task FIRST using the `mc` CLI
- Git commit + push is AUTOMATIC via `mc` CLI
- THEN delegate to sub-agent or work on it
- NO EXCEPTIONS
- **If Anthony asks for something and you don't add it to Mission Control = FAILURE**
- **Anthony monitors via Mission Control dashboard - if it's not there, he can't see what you're doing**

### Mission Control CLI (`mc`) Commands
```bash
# Create a new task (auto-commits and pushes to dashboard)
mc create "Task title" "Description" priority

# Validate task exists before working (REQUIRED check)
mc validate task_XXX

# Show full task details
mc show task_XXX

# Update subtask status
mc subtask task_XXX sub_001 done

# Add a comment to a task
mc comment task_XXX "Author" "Comment text"

# Update task status
mc status task_XXX in_progress|review|done|backlog

# List all tasks
mc list [status]

# Manual sync (rarely needed - all commands auto-sync)
mc sync "message"
```

### Workflow (USE THE CLI)
1. **User makes request** → Run `mc create "title" "description" priority`
2. **Before working** → Run `mc validate task_XXX` (REQUIRED!)
3. **While working** → Run `mc subtask task_XXX sub_001 done` to update progress
4. **Add updates** → Run `mc comment task_XXX "OpenClaw" "Progress update"`
5. **Complete** → Run `mc status task_XXX done`

All `mc` commands automatically:
- Update `/root/.openclaw/workspace/data/tasks.json`
- Commit to git with `Mission Control:` prefix
- Push to `dashboard` remote (GitHub Pages)

### Manual Git Workflow (backup - prefer CLI)
If `mc` CLI is unavailable:
1. Modify `/root/.openclaw/workspace/data/tasks.json`
2. `cd /root/.openclaw/workspace`
3. `git add data/tasks.json`
4. `git commit -m "Mission Control: <description>"`
5. **`git push dashboard main`** ← REQUIRED FOR DASHBOARD UPDATE
6. Verify push succeeded before continuing work

**Two remotes:**
- `origin`: mission-control repo (optional)
- `dashboard`: antonkonsta/mission-control-dashboard (REQUIRED - this is what GitHub Pages uses)

### VALIDATION ENFORCEMENT
**BEFORE starting any work on a task:**
```bash
mc validate task_XXX
```
This returns:
- ✅ if task exists (shows title, status, progress)
- ❌ if task doesn't exist (blocks work, tells you to create it)

**If validation fails, DO NOT WORK ON IT. Create the task first.**

## MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT CHECKS (EVERY heartbeat - do these FIRST)

### 1. Memory Health Check
Check if memory logging is working properly.

### 2. Token Usage Check
Monitor context window usage.

### 3. Learning Log Check
Verify failures are being logged.

### 4. Sub-Agent Supervision (CRITICAL)
Check ALL running sub-agents:
- List sub-agent sessions
- **MATCH each sub-agent to its Mission Control task** (by label or sessionKey)
- **EVERY sub-agent MUST be spawned with label=<task-name>** (e.g., "doordash-research", "voice-fix")
- **If you see "Unknown task" in Task Monitor = YOU FAILED TO NAME IT**
- Check last update time (if >2 min, demand status update from sub-agent)
- Review last message (if stuck/silent, prompt or kill+respawn)
- **Monitor until TRULY complete** - don't move to review until deliverable is done
- Update Mission Control task with sub-agent progress comments
- **ONLY move to 'review' when agent shows clear completion** (deliverable ready)
- Then ping Anthony
- Be STRICT - no excuses, demand results
- Kill and respawn failures immediately

## ACTIVE WORK CHECK (After enforcement)

### Check Running Work
1. **Mission Control tasks in 'in_progress':**
   - Read `/root/.openclaw/workspace/data/tasks.json`
   - Find tasks with `"status": "in_progress"`
   - **JUDGE PROGRESS:** If all subtasks done OR deliverable complete → move to 'review' AUTOMATICALLY
   - Continue working on them, update subtasks, add comments
   - **NEVER wait for Anthony to tell you to move tasks to review**
   - Move to 'review' when complete, commit to git

## WORK QUEUE CHECK (Priority Order)

1. **Mission Control 'backlog' (high priority first):**
   - Read `/root/.openclaw/workspace/data/tasks.json`
   - Find tasks with `"status": "backlog"`
   - Sort by priority: high → medium → low
   - If found → move to 'in_progress', start working

## EXECUTE OR REQUEST

- **If work found:** Start highest priority task, report what you're working on
- **If no work:** "No tasks queued. What should I work on next?"

## NEVER REPLY HEARTBEAT_OK IF THERE'S WORK

Only reply HEARTBEAT_OK if genuinely nothing to report.
